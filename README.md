🍎 This code features a search bar that allows users to search a preexisting
list of fruits and return a dropdown menu of any fruits that match their search.
Results are displayed with a scroll bar. Any matching characters are highlighted
in bold. When the user clicks on one of the fruits, the rest of the suggestions
disappear. 🍏
