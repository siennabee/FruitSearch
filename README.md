🍎 This code allows users to search a preexisting list of fruits and return a
dropdown menu of any fruits that match their search. Only the first ten results
are shown so as to not overwhelm users. Any matching characters are highlighted
in bold. When the user clicks on one of the fruits, the rest of the suggestions
disappear. 🍏
